== File Type Icons

File icons you can use for attachments with Paperclip or Attachment Fu or... anything. I didn't create them, just converted them to pngs, resized them and added a couple common file types (.ai, .psd, .rb (of course)).

== Use in Ruby on Rails
In Rails I put the following in a helper:

def icon_for(filename, options={})
  ext = filename.match(/[.](\w{1,6})\Z/)[1]
  size = "#{options[:size]}/" if options[:size]
  "/file_icons/#{size ||=""}#{ext}.png"
end

Pass it a filename and it returns the path to the proper icon. It does not check to make sure the icon exists.
